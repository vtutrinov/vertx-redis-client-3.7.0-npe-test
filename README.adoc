To run this example, you need a running Redis instance. Once running, you can configure the
verticles with the redis host:

----
{
    "host": "192.168.59.103"
}
----

By default it uses `127.0.0.1` as host. The port is set to `6379`.

Once the redis instance is running, you can launch it using:

----
# compile and build shaded jar
mvn clean package

mvn jar target/redis-example-fat.jar -conf config.json
